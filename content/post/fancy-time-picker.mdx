Requested by the community and essential for Shadcn UI, we have developed a copy-and-pasteable date-time picker.

This time picker emulates the default behavior of the native, non-customizable `<input type="time" />` element.

It listens for onKeyDown events before input and enables arrow keys for time navigation. Key features include:

- Arrow key navigation between hours and minutes.
- Increment and decrement of hours and minutes using arrow keys.
- Automatic input validation.
- After input, it waits for 2000ms for a second input value; otherwise, it resets and user starts with first input value.
- Automatic focus on minutes after hours input.
- Support for the "Tab" key to switch between inputs.

We utilize an `<input type="number" inputMode="decimal">` to trigger the native number keyboard on mobile devices.

We had to increase the font size to 16px to avoid automatic zooming on mobile devices.

> Current flaw: When selecting a new day, it will reset the time to 00:00.
